/**
 * Server-side state for a single KV full-scan session.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ScannerContext} holds a point-in-time RocksDB {@link Snapshot}, the {@link
 * ReadOptions} pinning it, and a cursor ({@link RocksIterator}) that persists across multiple
 * batched-fetch RPCs from the same client. It also holds a {@link ResourceGuard.Lease} that
 * prevents the underlying RocksDB instance from being closed while the scan is in progress.
 *
 * <p>Instances are created by {@link org.apache.fluss.server.kv.KvTablet#openScan} and registered
 * by {@link ScannerManager}. They must be closed when the scan completes, the client requests an
 * explicit close, or the session expires due to inactivity.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> The iterator cursor ({@link #advance()}, {@link #isValid()}, {@link
 * #currentValue()}) must be driven by only one thread at a time. {@link #close()} is thread-safe.
