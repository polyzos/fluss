/**
 * The merge engine for the primary key table.
 *
 * <p>A primary key table with a merge engine is a special kind of table, called "merge table".
 * Fluss provides 3 kinds of table: "primary key table", "log table", and "merge table". Merge table
 * is a primary key table that has a primary key definition but doesn't directly UPDATE and DELETE
 * rows in the table, and instead, it merges the append rows into a new data set according to the
 * defined {@link MergeEngineType}. Therefore, it doesn't support direct UPDATE (also
 * partial-update) and DELETE operations and only supports INSERT or APPEND operations.
 *
 * <p>Note: A primary key table doesn't have a merge engine by default.
